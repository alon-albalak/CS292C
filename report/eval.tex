\subsection{Planned approach}

We will take a set of artificial benchmarks chosen to have large classes of programs (abstract programs that contain many concrete ones) and for each benchmark calculate the time and number of demonstrations needed for the correct program to be in the top n results, with and without the proposed technique. We can also take more realistic benchmarks taken from actual user intentions and do the same for them. No direct comparison to other tools here.
