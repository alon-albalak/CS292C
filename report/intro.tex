In recent years, there has been an increase of technology used in daily lives, and a subsequent increase in the amount of data generated by the millions of users of such technologies. Not only is data being generated about the users, but internet-connected devices are gathering data on their own environment. In order to understand such data, as well as the underlying systems that the data represents, analysis needs to be done. Manipulating these vast quantities of data then becomes challenging, in part due to the need for skill in a programming language, otherwise, a user must do all their data manipulation manually on a spreadsheet.

Program synthesis is the task of automatically generating a computer program based on some user specifications, and since the 1950s, program synthesis has been the holy grail of computer science~\citep{PGL-010}. In program synthesis, the goal is to create a system that will return valid programs that fulfill a users specifications, when that is possible. When developing a program synthesis framework, there are numerous issues to be overcome. One major obstacle is how the to handle ambiguous user intents. If a users specifications are vague, then there may be many programs which satisfy the specifications, however those specifications may not entirely capture all of a users intent. In these situations, a user must make further amendments to their specifications, and thus the program will become more accurate to the underlying intent of the user. Another challenge is how to reduce calculation times, as there is a limit to how long a user is willing to wait for a solution to their desired specifications.

One solution to these challenges is incremental synthesis. An incremental synthesis system is designed in such a way that if the user gives an ambiguous intent then the system can return a program which fulfills the specifications. However, to handle the ambiguity, the system is able to make adjustments if further specifications are entered by the user to further indicate their intentions. Additionally, if the user does need to make amendments to their specifications, then a program synthesis system will need to run the synthesis over from scratch, whereas an incremental system can simply continue on from the calculations it has already done.
